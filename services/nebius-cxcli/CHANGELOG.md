[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

- Hardened release publishing so tagged wheels use the exact tag version and verify bundled portable component sources through shared release-catalog helpers.
- Limited release catalog ref rewriting to this monorepo's module sources and now fail release validation when external module sources are left on floating refs or local paths.
- Added PR-side coverage for release catalog rendering and wheel verification so release packaging errors are caught before tagging.
- Fixed `publish-release.sh --prep` changelog rewriting so moved release notes preserve Markdownlint-safe blank lines around lists and headings.

## [nebius-cxcli-v0.1.2] - 2026-03-20

- Prepare release `v0.1.2`.

## [nebius-cxcli-v0.1.1] - 2026-03-20

- Split the workflow model into generator-side commands for `config.yaml` and customer-side commands for deploying the rendered `generated/` artifacts.
- Added generated bundle manifests, stricter render reset guardrails, and customer-side validation for portable deployment bundles.
- Hardened local deploy and Flux apply/bootstrap flows with better readiness checks, clearer status output, and safer Flux recovery behavior.
- Aligned release packaging and GitHub workflows so published wheels bundle the rewritten portable release catalog instead of local development sources.

## [nebius-cxcli-v0.1.0] - 2026-02-22

- Initial scaffold for `nebius-cxcli`.
- Added `config.yaml` schema validation and deterministic renderers.
- Added Terraform, Flux, discover, inventory, and email commands.
