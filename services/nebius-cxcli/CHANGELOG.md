## [Unreleased]

- Simplified `bootstrap-ci` so reruns automatically reconcile the CLI-managed customer workflow to the latest generated contract; `--auth-bootstrap` remains enabled by default and workflow-only runs are now the explicit opt-out via `--no-auth-bootstrap`.
- Added regression coverage that `bootstrap-ci --help` and the command surface keep `--auth-bootstrap` enabled by default.
- Fixed customer-side Terraform plan/apply flows for private repos by persisting rendered tfvars in the generated manifest and recreating ignored `generated/infra/terraform.auto.tfvars.json` from that manifest before Terraform runs, both in CLI-generated bundle commands and generated customer workflows.
- Clarified and tested that `deploy <generated-dir>` remains a local/customer-side bundle operation only and does not auto-run `bootstrap-ci` or mutate GitHub CI workflow/environment state.

## [nebius-cxcli-v0.1.5] - 2026-03-22

- Added PR-side coverage for `bootstrap-ci` workflow generation across both development (`main`) and stable tagged (`nebius-cxcli-v<version>`) default CLI refs.
- Hardened `bootstrap-ci` to fail before writing the customer workflow when GitHub auth-bootstrap prerequisites are missing, and documented `--github-repo` as an override over target-repo auto-detection.
- Added explicit render profiles: generator-side `validate` and `render` now default to portable output, while `--render-profile local-dev` keeps checked-out Terraform module paths for workstation testing.
- Hardened generated-bundle validation and customer workflows with `validate-generated --portable`, so PR/apply pipelines reject non-portable local Terraform module sources before plan/apply.
- Simplified wheel/release packaging to bundle the portable catalog via the build override path instead of rewriting the working-tree root catalog during GitHub Actions builds.
- Aligned the generated customer workflow with the example repo by using a shared Python-version env and compact JSON discovery output for deterministic GitHub Actions matrix handoff.
- Added repo-side coverage that the checked-in local and portable catalogs stay semantically aligned except for Terraform module source addresses.
- Added direct tests for the `validate-sources` CLI command surface and GitHub environment-secret bootstrap helpers so those paths no longer rely only on indirect coverage.

## [nebius-cxcli-v0.1.4] - 2026-03-22

- Fixed packaged/bundled `component_sources.yaml` to always use the portable Git-backed catalog so source installs and customer CI no longer fall back to repo-local Terraform module paths.
- Added `bootstrap-ci --cli-ref` so generated customer workflows can be pinned explicitly to a branch, tag, or commit when validating nebius-cxcli changes end to end.
- Stabilized Flux bootstrap fallback coverage so tests no longer depend on live local `kubectl` state when asserting the bootstrap path.

## [nebius-cxcli-v0.1.3] - 2026-03-21

- Hardened release publishing so tagged wheels use the exact tag version and verify bundled portable component sources through shared release-catalog helpers.
- Limited release catalog ref rewriting to this monorepo's module sources and now fail release validation when external module sources are left on floating refs or local paths.
- Added PR-side coverage for release catalog rendering and wheel verification so release packaging errors are caught before tagging.
- Fixed `publish-release.sh --prep` changelog rewriting so moved release notes preserve Markdownlint-safe blank lines around lists and headings.

## [nebius-cxcli-v0.1.2] - 2026-03-20

- Prepare release `v0.1.2`.

## [nebius-cxcli-v0.1.1] - 2026-03-20

- Split the workflow model into generator-side commands for `config.yaml` and customer-side commands for deploying the rendered `generated/` artifacts.
- Added generated bundle manifests, stricter render reset guardrails, and customer-side validation for portable deployment bundles.
- Hardened local deploy and Flux apply/bootstrap flows with better readiness checks, clearer status output, and safer Flux recovery behavior.
- Aligned release packaging and GitHub workflows so published wheels bundle the rewritten portable release catalog instead of local development sources.

## [nebius-cxcli-v0.1.0] - 2026-02-22

- Initial scaffold for `nebius-cxcli`.
- Added `config.yaml` schema validation and deterministic renderers.
- Added Terraform, Flux, discover, inventory, and email commands.
