# Project Agent Instructions

## Scope

These instructions apply to this directory and all descendants.

Project root: `services/vpngw`

Closer nested instruction files may refine these defaults for their subtree.

## Context authority

- Requirements: `docs/requirements.md`
- Design: `docs/design.md`
- Read only the sections relevant to the boundary being changed.

## Change requirements

- Breaking a supported API, CLI contract, configuration or persisted format, or upgrade path requires explicit approval, a deprecation or migration plan, and regression coverage. Keep internals on one canonical path.
- This project has existing users. Preserve supported behavior and public interfaces across changes; treat unintended compatibility breakage as a regression.

## Security and operations

- For VM-HA promotion, require the former Compute owner to be Stopped and confirm the shared allocation on the candidate before forwarding or route reconciliation.
