# Changelog

All notable changes to the reusable Codex skills are tracked here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added this `skills/CHANGELOG.md` so reusable-skill release notes live with
  the skills instead of in the monorepo root changelog.
- Added the `align` Codex skill for end-to-end project review and repair passes
  that inspect a codebase broadly before editing, then fix inconsistencies
  across implementation, tests, CI, CLI/help output, documentation, and
  formatting instead of only reporting them.
- Added the `align-skill` Codex skill for reviewing and standardizing Codex or
  Agent Skill folders, including `SKILL.md`, references, assets, scripts,
  official vendor-doc verification, safety guardrails, canonical structure, and
  validation evidence.
- Added the `attach-ubuntu` Codex skill with a Bash helper that creates or
  reuses a per-project Ubuntu container, mounts the current project at
  `/workdir`, updates VS Code attached-container defaults, bootstraps Ubuntu
  build tools and Python project dependencies inside the container, isolates
  them in a container-specific virtual environment, preserves Git metadata for
  monorepo subprojects, and best-effort opens a new Dev Containers window for
  the running container.
- Added the `create-pr` Codex skill for branch-safe GitHub PR creation.
- Added the `onboard-nebius-cxcli` Codex skill as the central onboarding guide
  for Nebius Terraform modules that need to be wired into
  `services/nebius-cxcli`, including catalog-first onboarding and optional
  code-owned layers for wizard/provider, runtime validation, status polling,
  and cluster handoff behavior.
- Added the `publish-helm` Codex skill for creating Nebius OCI Helm chart
  publication flows.
- Added the `review-pr` Codex skill for GitHub-backed PR review and
  merge-readiness work.

### Changed

- Tightened the `helmchart` Codex skill with more accurate `appVersion`
  guidance, dependency-aware strict validation, safer securityContext and RBAC
  mutation rules, trigger-scope metadata, a reusable chart validation helper,
  and lightweight trigger eval prompts.
- Clarified the `align` Codex skill guidance and metadata so alignment passes
  operate as cautious senior code-review style sweeps: audit-first,
  evidence-driven, wiring-aware, conservative around public contracts and
  business logic, and still focused on fixing verified low-risk gaps across
  code, tests, docs, workflows, CLI/help output, config, and applicable project
  skills.
- Updated the `create-pr` guidance and metadata so Codex treats explicit
  user-supplied PR titles and bodies as authoritative instead of inferring a
  generic title from the branch name.
- Expanded `create-pr` so Codex can prepare one or more conflict-free PR
  branches against the default branch, use the current branch as the target
  when no branch is provided, check ordered multi-branch merge paths, preserve
  one PR per branch, and report the manual merge order.
- Expanded `review-pr` so Codex can review PRs by number, URL, or current
  branch, distinguish user-owned, same-repository, forked, writable, and
  externally owned branches, resolve safe base-branch conflicts only when
  permissions allow, and report exact blockers when a contributor branch cannot
  be updated.
- Renamed the Nebius cxcli onboarding skill to `onboard-nebius-cxcli`, updating
  the skill folder, `SKILL.md` metadata, OpenAI agent metadata, sibling-skill
  routing, repo docs, and nebius-cxcli documentation references.
- Updated `install-skills.sh` so source-owned renamed or removed skills
  converge on reinstall and target-only skills are listed at the end with a
  short default-target `--remove-skill` hint instead of being silently ignored.
  The installer help and README now state the no-argument install and default
  removal targets, plus the custom-destination removal form.
- Aligned the reusable skill set with current skill and workflow conventions:
  `align-skill`, `attach-ubuntu`, and `nebius` now state the repository
  script-execution policy explicitly, while `github-workflows`,
  `publish-image`, and `python-project` templates use current action major
  pins verified from upstream action repositories, and skill reference docs pass
  focused Markdown lint checks.
- Refined `create-pr` and `review-pr` to follow stronger Git and GitHub PR
  best practices: `create-pr` refreshes base-branch context, avoids opening
  PRs from a dirty tree alone, and prefers draft PRs for incomplete work, while
  `review-pr` distinguishes safe local rebases from shared-branch cases that
  should use non-destructive updates, preserves unresolved reviewer concerns as
  explicit blockers, and routes selectively to sibling skills.
- Expanded `skills/README.md` with explicit Codex chat prompt examples,
  including copy-pastable `create-pr` and `review-pr` usage plus the GitHub
  prerequisites those skills expect before they can act.
- Updated the shared `python-project` skill to explain when a minimal
  compatibility `setup.py` shim still makes sense alongside `pyproject.toml`.
